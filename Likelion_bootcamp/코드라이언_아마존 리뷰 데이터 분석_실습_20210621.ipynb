       "   The \"Find\" feature is simple. All it has to do is beep the earbuds so you can find them. But that's hidden inside the Galaxy Wearable app.<br/><br/>In order to beep your earbuds, you have to grant it access to *always on* location, storage on your device, your calendar, call logs, your contacts, the ability to make phone calls, and to send SMS messages. I also had to give it permission to INSTALL APPS on my phone, but since I couldn't find a way to take it back in settings, I assume it went to some Samsung system app somewhere, who knows where.<br/><br/>I didn't want to give it these things so I said deny. You know what the app does when you press deny? It just crashes. No graceful handling, they will not let you use the app unless they get your data.<br/><br/>I was desperate to find the earbuds, so I said whatever, and pressed OK to the mind numbing number of permissions dialogs. But that's not enough, it STILL won't let you beep your headphones unless you agree to the global Samsung privacy policy. Allow me to paste one small part of what you'e agreeing to:<br/><br/>*Sale of Personal Information*<br/>We may allow certain third parties (such as advertising partners) to collect your personal information.<br/><br/>So I gave up at this point, I had no idea it was even possible that buying earbuds could turn into a privacy nightmare, but Samsung made it possible. I just wanted to make the headphones beep, but I'll find them myself instead and return them.\n",

       "   These new Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus work great.  For those teetering potential buyers out there...<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>  - comes with three sizes of ear pads<br/>  - also comes with interchangeable \"winglet\" type fittings to adjust to your individual ear comfort<br/>  - battery lasted about 8h 20m listening to music a moderate level<br/>  - the charging case is glossy smooth and has a nice weight to it giving it a premium feel<br/>  - EXCELLENT sound that also allows external noise in for you to hear<br/>  - Bluetooth range is good: still connected when phone was in the back of the house and I was in the driveway<br/>  - You can make them beep if you lose them<br/>  - Easy to learn gesture controls: one tap, two taps, three taps, etc...<br/>  - Galaxy Wearable app is user-friendly<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>  - You need to download the Galaxy Wear app to get the most benefits<br/>  - Wearing them feels a bit awkward at first because of their noticeable weight<br/>  - The $149.99 price tag<br/><br/>Hope this helps...\n",

       "             These new Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus work great.  For those teetering potential buyers out there...<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>  - comes with three sizes of ear pads<br/>  - also comes with interchangeable \"winglet\" type fittings to adjust to your individual ear comfort<br/>  - battery lasted about 8h 20m listening to music a moderate level<br/>  - the charging case is glossy smooth and has a nice weight to it giving it a premium feel<br/>  - EXCELLENT sound that also allows external noise in for you to hear<br/>  - Bluetooth range is good: still connected when phone was in the back of the house and I was in the driveway<br/>  - You can make them beep if you lose them<br/>  - Easy to learn gesture controls: one tap, two taps, three taps, etc...<br/>  - Galaxy Wearable app is user-friendly<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>  - You need to download the Galaxy Wear app to get the most benefits<br/>  - Wearing them feels a bit awkward at first because of their noticeable weight<br/>  - The $149.99 price tag<br/><br/>Hope this helps...\n",

       "   My new daily drivers ahead of my Liberty Soundcore 2s. At first I was going to return these because they sound really low paired to my Galaxy S9 and they seemed not to pair to my iPhone 8. After watching Flossy’s video, I left them a bad review and then I watched Noah Herman’s video on how to pair them to my iPhone. Now I’m stoked. They work fine and sound much louder connected to that iPhone. I’m happy with my purchase and I highly recommend them. I never had the originals so I cannot compare them. I like the liberties but these are the truth. A+ AirPod killers.<br/><br/>Update :<br/>After only one week of pretty light use, they stopped connecting to each other and will only work one or the other... Not together.. I'm kinda teed off because for 150 bucks + tax I really  expected more. I'm sending them (actually taking them) back and I'm going back to my Soundcore's. These are off of my list. I really tried but at this point it's a hard NO! SAMSUNG needs to get it together.<br/>✊🏿\n",

       "   The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are well-priced and long-lasting wireless earbuds that may make you reconsider the need for active noise cancellation. After changing the silicone tips to ensure a fit for my ear with the included different sizes, the buds do a great job passively reducing noise by just blocking out sound, muting high pitched sounds and voices nearly as good (~80% airpods pro, ~30% Bose quietcomfort) as ANC products, though it doesn't block out lower frequencies well. The buds are comfortable and last for the whole day, and the ambient mode allows sound in with a touch of the buds so you can listen to your environment without taking the buds/music out.<br/><br/>*Pros*<br/>Long battery life - from 20 hours low use, 11 hours medium use, 8 hours high volume constant use, all without the case. With it, you can double it. No worries about running out of charge in the middle of the day.<br/>Comfortable to sleep with - the bud fits entirely in the ear (though this may not be the case with smaller ears) so I can even sleep on my side with them. This allows me to listen in bed without disturbing my housemates.<br/>Quick to recharge - if you fell asleep with them on, then it's no problem in the morning to pop them in the case for a couple of minutes to recharge and they'll be good to use for a good while (samsung claims 3 mins for an hour of playtime).<br/>So many buttons! - I can control volume up/down, play/pause, action left (previous track/video, for Audible previous 30s), action right (previous track/video, for Audible skip 30s), enable/disable Ambient mode, AND Google Voice command without touching the phone. The buttons are easy to use and responsive. To get the volume up/down ability, you need to enable an experimental feature which detects double tapping on the edge of the earbud (though I found that you can just tap on the back of your ear).<br/>Sound quality and modifications - the sound is really good for wireless earbuds (better than airpods pro), and you can choose from a set of preset equalizer modes.<br/>Size and weight - both the buds and the case are very lightweight. The case is small and easily pocketable, though it is a little too large to put on a keychain.<br/>Call quality - excellent call quality even in noisy situations. It's like active noise cancelling for whoever you are calling. I'm interested to see the next generation earbuds combine Apple's ANC and in-ear microsecond adjustments with Samsung's three-mic adaptive call system.<br/>Comfort - the buds are very comfortable (after changing the silicone wingtips to fit) which pairs well with the long battery life.<br/>Bluetooth signal - the buds can transmit around 40ft clear line of sight and 20ft through walls, though this will be limited by the transmitting device as well (tested with Samsung Note 10+).<br/>Built-in wireless charging - case comes with wireless charging capability.<br/>Water resistant - though not waterproof, the buds still work under mild splashing and recover from splashes with a paper towel.<br/>Stays in ear - there's is no way the earbud is coming out of your ear by accident. Even falling down, it stays in your ear.<br/><br/>*Cons*<br/>No active noise cancellation - loud buzzing, humming, car sounds, etc. is not well filtered by passive noise reduction. Would not recommend for frequent fliers who need to hear their music.<br/>No dual connection - these buds were originally advertised as being able to connect to two different devices at once, but the feature has since been removed from the product description. I'm optimistic this will change in a future firmware update.<br/>Ambient mode picks up high frequencies too well - I think the ambient mode picks up on the high frequencies (whistles, snaps, pops) of sounds too well. Using ambient mode on a windy day sounds like listening to wind through a mic (which it is!).<br/>Sound distortion - I use the buds with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Sometimes, when using the buds for a while with my phone in my pocket and then taking the phone out of my pocket, the sound briefly becomes slightly robotic before returning to normal. I think this has to do with how the buds adjust to signal strength to correct sound.<br/>Setup - you can pair without quickly, though to get additional support though the Galaxy Wear app, it takes a minute for the first setup.<br/>Logistics - the included charging cable is a little short.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the quality and all-day usability of these earbuds warrants giving up ANC, especially since I am not in situations with lots of low frequency noise and since the buds already block out a lot of sound.\n",

       "   These are a decent set of true wireless earbuds.  I have only had them for one day, so I may need to adjust this review later, but I have tried them in several ways and tried most of the options.<br/><br/>They are comfortable and come with three sets of tips and wings.  The wings help to keep the buds in your ear by hooking to the inner fold in your ear once twisted into place -- you can't feel them, but if you try to take out the earbuds, they have to be twisted to come out -- thus they feel secure in your ear.<br/><br/>I also like that they can be used in either ear a single earbud -- you can have one charging in the case and use the other and then switch.  It is also nice that when you take both out, it automatically pauses audio (or video).  It does not automatically resume audio/video, but you can do that with a single tap.<br/><br/>The ambient noise mode seems to work pretty well but I have noticed a whistling noise when moving quickly such as walking fast or running.  I can definitely notice a difference with ambient noise with it on and with increasing/decreasing the sensitivity via the Wear app.<br/><br/>The case is nice and small, but I think that is why it only stores one full charge in it, but I have not tested the battery life yet.<br/><br/>The sound is good with these earbuds.  The equalizer could use more options.  Call quality is decent, maybe a little tinny.  Also, the person on the other side of my phone call reported distortion in wind, I am a little disappointed as I thought the extra microphones would be better at filtering out noise that was not my voice from the call.<br/><br/>The touch controls are pretty sensitive and the only one you can customize is the long tap and there are limited options of volume (left lowers and right increases volume), voice command, or ambient sound (which turns it off or on, does not change the sensitivity).\n",

      "['The \"Find\" feature is simple. All it has to do is beep the earbuds so you can find them. But that\\'s hidden inside the Galaxy Wearable app.In order to beep your earbuds, you have to grant it access to *always on* location, storage on your device, your calendar, call logs, your contacts, the ability to make phone calls, and to send SMS messages. I also had to give it permission to INSTALL APPS on my phone, but since I couldn\\'t find a way to take it back in settings, I assume it went to some Samsung system app somewhere, who knows where.I didn\\'t want to give it these things so I said deny. You know what the app does when you press deny? It just crashes. No graceful handling, they will not let you use the app unless they get your data.I was desperate to find the earbuds, so I said whatever, and pressed OK to the mind numbing number of permissions dialogs. But that\\'s not enough, it STILL won\\'t let you beep your headphones unless you agree to the global Samsung privacy policy. Allow me to paste one small part of what you\\'e agreeing to:*Sale of Personal Information*We may allow certain third parties (such as advertising partners) to collect your personal information.So I gave up at this point, I had no idea it was even possible that buying earbuds could turn into a privacy nightmare, but Samsung made it possible. I just wanted to make the headphones beep, but I\\'ll find them myself instead and return them.', 'I received these earbuds today. To set them up you need to install Samsung\\'s \"Galaxy Wearable\" app. My phone is a Google Pixel 3 (Android) and I installed the app from the Google Play Store. But the app refuses to get past the initial start screen unless you give it permission to access all your contacts, storage and location (see the screenshot). I tried granting it permission to everything except contacts but it just quits and when I start it again it asks for that permission again. Samsung\\'s explanation for the \"Contacts\" permission is this cryptic nonsense:  \"Used to provide services that need to be linked with accounts using registered Samsung account information\"So it basically comes down to this: you either hand over your all contacts to Samsung or you won\\'t be able to use the earbuds you purchased. This looks like a serious disregard for customers\\' privacy and is extremely user-hostile.Without the app, the buds still connect to the phone but only the left bud is working. The right bud is completely silent.I have used other bluetooth earbuds in the past (AirPods, Jaybirds, etc) and none of them ever required permission to contacts, storage or location. I\\'ll be returning the Galaxy Buds+ and look for another option from a different manufacturer.', \"I already had the buds and now own the buds+I've made different test with music and recording the microphone and so far they both have the same sound quality.I even played the same song on different devices at the same time using the new ones and the old ones at the same time on on alternate ears.... I must say its the same thing... so if you already have the old ones and dont care about battery life, its seems like it's the same thing to keep the old ones... I might return the new ones, I just want to test both of them on phone calls, that will be the factor that will make me choose if I should keep or return the new ones....4 stars because it seems like they are the same as the old ones, will give 5 if they pass the phone call test later on this week.... will keep you posted... So I tested them out for a couple days now,These have better connectivity, now I can watch movies on my laptop using the headphones and the sound works perfect, battery lasts much longer and now I can finally do phonecalls with them and people can actually hear me.These are great, better than the last ones 10/10 would recommend.Happy shopping!\", 'These new Samsung Galaxy Buds+ Plus work great.  For those teetering potential buyers out there...PROS:  - comes with three sizes of ear pads  - also comes with interchangeable \"winglet\" type fittings to adjust to your individual ear comfort  - battery lasted about 8h 20m listening to music a moderate level  - the charging case is glossy smooth and has a nice weight to it giving it a premium feel  - EXCELLENT sound that also allows external noise in for you to hear  - Bluetooth range is good: still connected when phone was in the back of the house and I was in the driveway  - You can make them beep if you lose them  - Easy to learn gesture controls: one tap, two taps, three taps, etc...  - Galaxy Wearable app is user-friendlyCONS:  - You need to download the Galaxy Wear app to get the most benefits  - Wearing them feels a bit awkward at first because of their noticeable weight  - The $149.99 price tagHope this helps...', \"My new daily drivers ahead of my Liberty Soundcore 2s. At first I was going to return these because they sound really low paired to my Galaxy S9 and they seemed not to pair to my iPhone 8. After watching Flossy’s video, I left them a bad review and then I watched Noah Herman’s video on how to pair them to my iPhone. Now I’m stoked. They work fine and sound much louder connected to that iPhone. I’m happy with my purchase and I highly recommend them. I never had the originals so I cannot compare them. I like the liberties but these are the truth. A+ AirPod killers.Update :After only one week of pretty light use, they stopped connecting to each other and will only work one or the other... Not together.. I'm kinda teed off because for 150 bucks + tax I really  expected more. I'm sending them (actually taking them) back and I'm going back to my Soundcore's. These are off of my list. I really tried but at this point it's a hard NO! SAMSUNG needs to get it together.✊🏿\", \"The Samsung Galaxy Buds+ are well-priced and long-lasting wireless earbuds that may make you reconsider the need for active noise cancellation. After changing the silicone tips to ensure a fit for my ear with the included different sizes, the buds do a great job passively reducing noise by just blocking out sound, muting high pitched sounds and voices nearly as good (~80% airpods pro, ~30% Bose quietcomfort) as ANC products, though it doesn't block out lower frequencies well. The buds are comfortable and last for the whole day, and the ambient mode allows sound in with a touch of the buds so you can listen to your environment without taking the buds/music out.*Pros*Long battery life - from 20 hours low use, 11 hours medium use, 8 hours high volume constant use, all without the case. With it, you can double it. No worries about running out of charge in the middle of the day.Comfortable to sleep with - the bud fits entirely in the ear (though this may not be the case with smaller ears) so I can even sleep on my side with them. This allows me to listen in bed without disturbing my housemates.Quick to recharge - if you fell asleep with them on, then it's no problem in the morning to pop them in the case for a couple of minutes to recharge and they'll be good to use for a good while (samsung claims 3 mins for an hour of playtime).So many buttons! - I can control volume up/down, play/pause, action left (previous track/video, for Audible previous 30s), action right (previous track/video, for Audible skip 30s), enable/disable Ambient mode, AND Google Voice command without touching the phone. The buttons are easy to use and responsive. To get the volume up/down ability, you need to enable an experimental feature which detects double tapping on the edge of the earbud (though I found that you can just tap on the back of your ear).Sound quality and modifications - the sound is really good for wireless earbuds (better than airpods pro), and you can choose from a set of preset equalizer modes.Size and weight - both the buds and the case are very lightweight. The case is small and easily pocketable, though it is a little too large to put on a keychain.Call quality - excellent call quality even in noisy situations. It's like active noise cancelling for whoever you are calling. I'm interested to see the next generation earbuds combine Apple's ANC and in-ear microsecond adjustments with Samsung's three-mic adaptive call system.Comfort - the buds are very comfortable (after changing the silicone wingtips to fit) which pairs well with the long battery life.Bluetooth signal - the buds can transmit around 40ft clear line of sight and 20ft through walls, though this will be limited by the transmitting device as well (tested with Samsung Note 10+).Built-in wireless charging - case comes with wireless charging capability.Water resistant - though not waterproof, the buds still work under mild splashing and recover from splashes with a paper towel.Stays in ear - there's is no way the earbud is coming out of your ear by accident. Even falling down, it stays in your ear.*Cons*No active noise cancellation - loud buzzing, humming, car sounds, etc. is not well filtered by passive noise reduction. Would not recommend for frequent fliers who need to hear their music.No dual connection - these buds were originally advertised as being able to connect to two different devices at once, but the feature has since been removed from the product description. I'm optimistic this will change in a future firmware update.Ambient mode picks up high frequencies too well - I think the ambient mode picks up on the high frequencies (whistles, snaps, pops) of sounds too well. Using ambient mode on a windy day sounds like listening to wind through a mic (which it is!).Sound distortion - I use the buds with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Sometimes, when using the buds for a while with my phone in my pocket and then taking the phone out of my pocket, the sound briefly becomes slightly robotic before returning to normal. I think this has to do with how the buds adjust to signal strength to correct sound.Setup - you can pair without quickly, though to get additional support though the Galaxy Wear app, it takes a minute for the first setup.Logistics - the included charging cable is a little short.Overall, I think the quality and all-day usability of these earbuds warrants giving up ANC, especially since I am not in situations with lots of low frequency noise and since the buds already block out a lot of sound.\", \"Bought these for the ambient noise. I've only ever used one ear bud. Thought these would be a great way to enjoy using both.However that feature is only available when using a app that requires access to everything on your phone. This is unacceptable. It should be available stand alone. A simple pattern a pushes wouldn't have been hard to add. Guess the opportunity to make more profit was to hard for them to pass up.\", \"Sound quality was very disappointing.  I bought them based on consumer reports saying good sound, but it didn't deliver.  I have some great workout music that I love with strong bass, but it was tinny and weak on these Samsung buds plus. I then tried Beats and Bose, and only the Bose delivered the full bass and range I was looking for, with great ambient noise islation as well.\", \"These are a decent set of true wireless earbuds.  I have only had them for one day, so I may need to adjust this review later, but I have tried them in several ways and tried most of the options.They are comfortable and come with three sets of tips and wings.  The wings help to keep the buds in your ear by hooking to the inner fold in your ear once twisted into place -- you can't feel them, but if you try to take out the earbuds, they have to be twisted to come out -- thus they feel secure in your ear.I also like that they can be used in either ear a single earbud -- you can have one charging in the case and use the other and then switch.  It is also nice that when you take both out, it automatically pauses audio (or video).  It does not automatically resume audio/video, but you can do that with a single tap.The ambient noise mode seems to work pretty well but I have noticed a whistling noise when moving quickly such as walking fast or running.  I can definitely notice a difference with ambient noise with it on and with increasing/decreasing the sensitivity via the Wear app.The case is nice and small, but I think that is why it only stores one full charge in it, but I have not tested the battery life yet.The sound is good with these earbuds.  The equalizer could use more options.  Call quality is decent, maybe a little tinny.  Also, the person on the other side of my phone call reported distortion in wind, I am a little disappointed as I thought the extra microphones would be better at filtering out noise that was not my voice from the call.The touch controls are pretty sensitive and the only one you can customize is the long tap and there are limited options of volume (left lowers and right increases volume), voice command, or ambient sound (which turns it off or on, does not change the sensitivity).\", \"I bought these Samsung  Buds+ in April 2020 and they quit working in July 2020.I sent a message back to this seller and obviously I was out of the time-frame for a return.So they told me to deal with Samsung for the warranty. So I did.Samsung then told me my warranty is voided because the set I received was an international model,  NOT THE AMERICAN MODEL!!!!!I was so pissed. Then they wanted $108 to repair these headphones.If your American, don't even buy these because your going to get screwed like I did!The only way to make this right is to let me exchange these for another pair or give me a refund!\"]\n"
