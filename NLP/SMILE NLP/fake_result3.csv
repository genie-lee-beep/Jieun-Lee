The rising and dropping would become more violent with a side to side motion as well. Sounds of crashing waves and thunder would echo across the boat. Eventually the boat would begin to lower beneath the fake waves, and the ride would end. ,5,,"

"If I were to create a ride to represent the plot point of Crusoe's first voyage, the ride would be a spinning boat going up a tower. Riders would board and the &quot;boat&quot; would go up. Then, the &quot;boat&quot; would start spinning and going down. There might be shower heads over the seats to spray water over the riders' heads. When the &quot;boat&quot; reaches the bottom, the riders would have to step on a raft to get out. The water would be choppy and the raft would be swaying. This is when Crusoe's ship sinks on his first voyage and he gets rescued. ,3.33,,"
"To show how Robinson Crusoe searched the ship I will create a ride wear you will sit in a car by yourself, and steer through a pretend ship. You will start in 2 feet deep water, and drive through it till you get next to the ship, where you will be pulled on to it. After that you can steer yourself, as if   in a go kart, to the exit at the other end of the ship. Once you go through the exit, you will be back at the entrance, and you will give your car to the next person.,3,,"
"If I would make a ride in a amuesment park about Robinson Crusoue it would be about his first voyage. The ride is a big cup like pot made out of metal. First the passengers enter the cup like pot. Then when everyone enters the cup like pot, it slowly starts moving side to side and up to down just like a boat does. After that, turbo fans around the cup like pot start blowing. Then all the passengers in the cup like pot feel there is a storm that is affecting their cup like pot. After some time, fake water would rise in front of the cup like pot and the ride ends.,3.25,,"
"To give the the riders the idea of a sinking ship is the riders would get in the ride which was a boat and fasten their seat belt. When everybody was done they would push a button and the ride would start. The ship would sink through a crack in an arch. The arch would be filled with real water with many sea animals to relate to an ocean. The arch would closed so the the water is not leaking on them. At this time the ride would be almost at the end. When they reach the top through another hole. The ride is done.,2.6,,"
"If I was to create a ride where Crusoe was experiencing his first sea voyage, I would create a scary ride. My ride would be a water ride. People would go on a fake ship, put on  safety features such as seat belts and safety bars. Then, the ride would start. The ship would start rocking back and forth  to indicate waves. Water would splash on to the ship, making it feel like the ship was sinking. After about thirty seconds, the ship would stop rocking and the ride would come to an end. ,3.57,,"
"If I was to create a ride to represent the first voyage taken by Crusoe, the ride would have many exiting moments. Some of these moments would involve water, steep drops, and big waves. The first part of the ride would have the passengers step on board the ship and strap into a seat for safety. Next, the ship will start swaying and rocking side to side. Then, after the ship sways, the boat dips into the water and will make big waves. Finally, when the ride starts to slow down, it stops at a post and then all the passengers exit when the ride people tell them to.,3.17,,"
"For Crusoe's first voyage, the people would get onto a large ship (much like his) and hold on tight.Soon after, the ship would start shaking, and start to move violently. Meanwhile, fake waves would beat against the ship, and fans would blow everywhere.  After about three minutes, the ride would end and the next group of people would get on.,3.13,,"
